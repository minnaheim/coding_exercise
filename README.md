# Coding Interview Exercise

This is my submission of a coding exercise I did to apply for a research assistant position. I had a three hour time limit to complete it! You can find the html of this file [here](https://minnaheim.github.io/coding_exercise/). I also added the task description, which you can find under "Task.pdf".
